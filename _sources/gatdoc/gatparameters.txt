Parameters
==========

In this chapter we describe how parameters are handled in GATHODE,
which parameters exist and which properties they influence.

.. _changing parameters:

Changing parameters
-------------------

In GATHODE, the extraction of properties (such as maximal growth rate,
growth yield, etc.) depends on certain parameters.

Some parameters are defined for the whole plate, whereas other
parameters can have plate-wide defaults which can be overridden for
each replicate group or even each single well.

To change a plate parameter or a plate default parameter, make sure no
replicate is selected from the list. Parameters which have been
explicitly set have a white background, parameters without a value
have a grey background. In the following screenshot, the lower cutoff
of the maximal growth is set while the upper cutoff of the maximal
growth values is unset.

   :alt: Plate default parameters

Parameters can also be set for a single :samp:`{sample}_{condition}`
replicate group, or even for a single well. Parameters are inherited from
plate to replicate group and from replicate group to single well. Parameters
inherited from the plate that are not changed by any of the *child*
wells (wells constituting the replicate group) have a grey background,
parameters explicitly set without a change in its *child* wells have a
white background. Parameters that are modified in at least one of the
underlying single wells but are otherwise set to the plate-wide
default change their background colour from grey to white from top to
bottom. In contrast, the background of parameters that are explicitly
set and at least one of the underlying single wells has a modified
value, change from grey to white from left to right. In the screenshot
below, the lower cutoff for the maximal growth rate is explicitly
changed for the selected replicate group, and in at least one of its *child*
wells the value is changed further. The value of the upper cutoff is
not changed for this replicate group, but one of the *child* wells has a
differing value.

Parameter descriptions
----------------------

Normal Parameters
:::::::::::::::::


.. _high density correction parameters:

High density correction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The optical density at high values is corrected by a cubic function
whose parameters are the three coefficients a\ :sub:`1`, a\ :sub:`2`
and a\ :sub:`3`. For details see :ref:`High density correction <High
density correction>`.


.. _logOD cutoff:

``log(OD)`` cutoff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allows to restrain the detection of all properties to locations where
the value of :math:`\log{\textrm{OD}}` is above this cutoff. This can
ensure that the noise at low OD does not hamper the detection
algorithms. Further, all figures use this as the lower value of the
OD-range in the log-scale.


.. _smoothing:

Smoothing
~~~~~~~~~

To obtain a smoother curve of the optical density, it can be
preprocessed by a smoothing spline. In GATHODE the function
`UnivariateSpline
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline.html>`_
from the `SciPy <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/>`_ library
is used for this and the two parameters ``k`` and ``s`` correspond to
the degree of the smoothing spline and the smoothing factor,
respectively.

The outcome of the :ref:`growth yield` is influenced by these
parameters, as well as the graphs of the smoothed ``OD`` and smoothed
``log(OD)``.


.. _fit window:

Fit window
~~~~~~~~~~

The fit window defines the number of data-points that are included in
fits locally around a data-point. Such fits are performed when
determining the :ref:`maximal growth rate <maximal growth rate>` and
to identify the :ref:`growth yield`.


.. _lag at:

Lag at
~~~~~~

The interception of the exponential function at
:math:`\mu^\textrm{max}` with this value defines the lag time, see
:ref:`section about maximal growth rate <maximal growth rate>`.


.. _maximal growth cutoff:

Maximal growth cutoff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cutoff values allow to constrain the time of the :ref:`maximal
growth rate <maximal growth rate>` :math:`\mu^\textrm{max}`. This may
be especially useful at low OD, as fits of an exponential function
may be difficult and thus result in noisy estimations of :math:`\mu`
leading to a false identification of its maximum.



Special Parameters
::::::::::::::::::

Two parameters may only be changed when they are not hidden
(:menuselection:`File --> Settings`). The reason for this is that
these make the results mathematically less strict, therefore caution
has to be exercised when changing these.


.. _allow at cutoff:

Allow maximal growth at cutoff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an :ref:`interval <maximal growth cutoff>` for the maximal growth
is specified, the location of :math:`\mu^\textrm{max}` must not be at
the endpoints of the interval, as this would mean a local maximum
could not be found.

This strict requirement of a local maximum can be loosened by setting
the parameter ``allow at cutoff``, which mathematically means that
the derivative to of :math:`\mu` may be non-zero.


.. _allow n stderr slope:

Allow growth yield's slope to be zero within n standard errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The requirement that the slope of a linear regression in a fit-window
around a data-point is zero within one standard error can be loosened
to ``n`` standard errors.
