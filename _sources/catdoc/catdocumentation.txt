Getting started
===============

In this tutorial we describe how to get started with the Chronological
life span Analysis Tool for High-throughput Optical Density
Experiments (CATHODE). Make sure you have first read the
:ref:`Getting started chapter of GATHODE <gatgettingstarted>`.

Plan, run and export plate reader experiment
--------------------------------------------

When performing a chronological life span analysis, each plate
corresponds to one ``age-point``, and all plates must have exactly the
same layout of samples/conditions per well.

Analyse the data
----------------

After finishing all your experiment with the plate reader, process
every plate as explained in the :ref:`GATHODE documentation
<gatgettingstarted>`.

Once this is done, the files saved by GATHODE are ready for import
into CATHODE. Create a new project by choosing :menuselection:`File
--> New`. A selection window will pop up that allows to select the
files and assign an age-point to them.

When the files are imported, you will see the list of samples that you
are already familiar with from GATHODE, and the main figure will show
the viability graph.

As with GATHODE, you can save the figures in PDF format
(:menuselection:`File --> Export figure`) and a table in CSV
(comma-separated values) format including the viabilities and the
survival integral (:menuselection:`File --> Export properties`).

Save, load and reload  CLS data
-------------------------------

You can save the CLS data from the menu by choosing
:menuselection:`File --> Save as`. Note though that the GATHODE
plate files themselves are not included in the saved file, only their
locations are stored. You should therefore not move the GATHODE files
to another directory, as CLS will then not be able to locate them. But
you can move the CLS file together with the accompanying GATHODE files
to another directory, as long as the relative positions in the
directory tree stay the same.

You may change the underlying GATHODE files of a CLS analysis and then
reload these by selecting :menuselection:`File --> Reload`.
