Installing GATHODE and CATHODE from source
******************************************

Dependencies
============

To install GATHODE and CATHODE from source, you will need to install
its dependencies. These are

* `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_
* `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
* `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_
* `PyQt <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt>`_

You also need to install the `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_
Python package installer (often included in a Python distribution)
unless you are a proficient Python developer.


Linux
-----

On Debian (version 7 ``wheezy`` and 8 ``jessie``) and Ubuntu (version
12.04 and 14.04), install the dependencies with the following command
(being root or using ``sudo``)

::

    apt-get install python-qt4 python-sip python-scipy python-matplotlib python-pip 

On Fedora (release ``heisenbug``), install the dependencies like this

::

    yum -y install python-pip PyQt4 sip scipy python-matplotlib-qt4

Then you should be able to install the python package with

::

    pip install https://github.com/platereader/gathode/archive/master.zip

If you don't have root permissions, follow the instructions below
using a :ref:`virtual environment <virtualenvironment>`.


OS X
----

One option to install Python and all the required dependencies is to
use `MacPorts <https://www.macports.org/>`_. Install it and run

::

    port install py27-pyqt4-devel py27-matplotlib py27-scipy

and then

::

    pip install https://github.com/platereader/gathode/archive/master.zip


Windows
-------

`Python(x,y) <https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy>`_ includes all the
required dependencies. Install it and run from Command Prompt
(cmd.exe)

::

    pip install https://github.com/platereader/gathode/archive/master.zip


.. _virtualenvironment:

Virtual environments
====================

If you would like to use a `virtual environment
<http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/>`_ to isolate this software's
dependencies, you will still need to install Python and PyQt
(including sip), see above. Then set up the virtual environment with

::

    virtualenv ATHODEs
    source ATHODEs/bin/activate

PyQt, the graphical user interface library used by this program, can
not be installed with standard Python tools. To install it in your
virtual environment, follow e.g. `this
<http://stackoverflow.com/a/9716100>`_ procedure.

Then you should be able to install the gathode package with

::

    pip install https://github.com/platereader/gathode/archive/master.zip
